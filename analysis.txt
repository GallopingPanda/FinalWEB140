The site performs quite well and has very fast load time under 200ms. Also, the animations of the jquery scripts are fluid and perform well. After running an audit, the site scored a 72 in performance, which is a lower than I expected. The images, and the format I used, jpeg, are quite large even when they are scaled down. This could be fixed by compressing the images. The images are also not properly sized or optimized which took a chunk out of the performance score. When snapshotting memory usage, it uses on average 6.5 mb which is quite low. The page is secure with valid HTTPS and a strong connection. 

Accessibility scored 66 as I neglected to add alt tags, and links don’t have discernable names. According to the SEO audit, 90% of text is too small, and there is no meta description. Overall the site could be tweaked only slightly in order to bump up all of the audit scores. 

One thing I noticed is that in Chrome’s dev tools, the site almost looks like it isn’t responsive, whereas when I use Firefox’s dev tools, everything looks fine. I’m not sure if this is an issue that I could fix in any way, but it is worth noting. When I pull the site up on my phone, it looks like it does in Chrome, not very good. This is frustrating because when doing my responsive design, I was using Firefox to check back and forth how my changes were affecting the mobile layout, and they looked fine there. 

The site could definitely use some media queries in order to make the images more responsive, but I’m not sure what to do about the site’s appearance on my phone and on Chrome. It looks as if the whole site is set to 50% width, but I can’t find or think of anything in my files that would have this effect
